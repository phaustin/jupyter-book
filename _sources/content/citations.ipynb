    "\n",
    "Because `jupyter-book` is built on top of {term}`Sphinx`, we can use the excellent\n",
    "[sphinxcontrib-bibtex](https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",
    "extension to include citations and a bibliography with your book.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Citations and bibliographies\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add citations and bibliographies using references that are stored in a\n",
    "`bibtex` file that is in your book's folder. You can then add a citation in-line in your\n",
    "markdown with the **`{cite}`** role, and add a bibliography from your bibtex file\n",
    "with the `{bibliography}` directive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To add citations to your book**, take the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a references bibtex file**.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   touch references.bib\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Add references**. Add some references to your BibTex file. See\n",
    "   [the BibTex documentation](http://www.bibtex.org/Using/) for information about\n",
    "   the BibTex reference style. Here's an example citation:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   @article{perez2011python\n",
    "   ,\ttitle\t= {Python: an ecosystem for scientific computing}\n",
    "   ,\tauthor\t= {Perez, Fernando and Granger, Brian E and Hunter, John D}\n",

    "   ,\tyear\t= {2011}\n",
    "   ,\tpublisher\t= {AIP Publishing}\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **Add a citation**. In your content, add the following text to include a citation\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   {cite}`mybibtexcitation`\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, this text\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   {cite}`perez2011python`\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   generates this citation: {cite}`perez2011python`\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can also include multiple citations in one go, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   {cite}`perez2011python,holdgraf_rapid_2016,RePEc:the:publsh:1367,caporaso2010qiime`\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   becomes {cite}`perez2011python,holdgraf_rapid_2016,RePEc:the:publsh:1367,caporaso2010qiime`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add a bibliography**. Use the following directive to do so:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ````\n",
    "   ```{bibliography} path/to/references.bib\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   ````\n",
    "\n",
    "   This will generate a bibliography for your entire bibtex file. See\n",
    "   [the bibliography at the end of this page](citations/bibliography) for an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When your book is built, the bibliography and citations will now be included.\n",
    "\n",
    "`````{warning}\n",
    "If you are adding a bibliography to a *different* page from your references, then\n",
    "you may need to ensure that page is processed last, which Sphinx does alphabetically.\n",
    "For example, name the file `zreferences.rst`.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [this `sphinxcontrib-bibtex` section](https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#unresolved-citations-across-documents)\n",

    "bibliographies in your book. Though note the documentation\n",
    "is written for rST and you'll need to adapt the directive/role syntax for your\n",
    "markdown content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting your reference style\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also optionally customize the style of your references.\n",
    "By default, references are displayed in the `alpha` style.\n",
    "Other currently supported styles include `plain`, `unsrt`, and `unsrtalpha`.\n",
    "These styles create the following bibliography formatting:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `alpha`: Use alphanumeric reference labels, citations are sorted by author, year.\n",
    "* `plain`: Use numeric reference labels, citations are sorted by author, year.\n",
    "* `unsrt`: Use numeric reference labels, citations are sorted by order of appearance.\n",
    "* `unsrtalpha`: Use alphanumeric reference labels, citations are sorted by order of appearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set your reference style, use the style option:\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "```{bibliography} path/to/references.bib\n",
    ":style: unsrt\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local Bibliographies\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wish to include a bibliography listing at the end of each document\n",
    "rather than having a single bibliography contained in a separate document.\n",
    "Having multiple bibliography directives, however, can cause `sphinx` to issue\n",
    "`duplicate citation warnings`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common fix is to add a filter to the bibliography directives:\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "```{bibliography} path/to/references.bib\n",
    ":filter: docname in docnames\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "See `sphinxcontrib-bibtex` documentation for [local bibliographies](https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#section-local-bibliographies)\n",

    "## Cross-references and labels\n",
    "\n",
    "Labels are a way to add tags to parts of your content that you can reference\n",
    "later on. This is helpful if you want to quickly insert links to other\n",
    "parts of your book. Labels can be added before major elements of a page,\n",
    "such as titles or figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a label, use the following pattern **before** the element you wish\n",

    "## Cross-references and labels\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can insert cross-references to labels in your content with the following\n",
    "syntax: `` {ref}`label-text` ``. For example, the following syntax:\n",
    "`` {ref}`labels-and-refs` `` results in a link to this section like so:\n",
    "{ref}`labels-and-refs`.\n",

    "### Referencing your book's content\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to reference your book's content, depending on what kind of\n",
    "content you'd like to reference. Here is a quick overview of some common options:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `{ref}` is used to reference section labels that you define or figures with a `name` value\n",
    "* `{numref}` is used to provide *numbered* references to figures\n",
    "* `{doc}` is used to reference other files in your book\n",
    "* `{eq}` is used to reference equations that have been given a `label` value\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "You can reference a section label through ``{ref}`label` `` or ``{ref}`some text <label>` ``.\n",
    "Documents can be referenced through ``{doc}`path/to/document` `` or ``{doc}`some text <path/to/document>` ``\n",
