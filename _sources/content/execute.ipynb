    "# Execute and cache your pages\n",

    "Jupyter Book can automatically run and cache any notebook pages. Notebooks can either\n",
    "be run each time the documentation is built, or cached locally so that notebooks\n",
    "will only be re-run when the code cells in a notebook have changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cacheing behavior is controlled with the `execute:` section\n",
    "[in your `_config.yml` file](../customize/config). See\n",
    "the sections below for each configuration option and its effect.\n",

    "## Trigger notebook execution\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Jupyter Book will execute any content files that have a notebook structure,\n",
    "and that are missing at least one output. This is equivalent to the following\n",
    "configuration in _config.yml`:\n",

    "  execute_notebooks: auto\n",

    "This will only execute notebooks that are missing at least one output. If\n",

    "## Cacheing the notebook execution\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also **cache the results of executing a notebook page** using [jupyter-cache]. In\n",
    "this case, when a page is executed, its outputs will be stored in a local database.\n",
    "This allows you to be sure that the outputs in your documentation are up-to-date,\n",
    "while saving time avoiding unnecessary re-execution. It also allows you to store your\n",
    "`.ipynb` files in your `git` repository *without their outputs*, but still leverage\n",
    "a cache to save time when building your site.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you re-build your site, the following will happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Notebooks that have not seen changes to their **code cells** since the last build\n",
    "  will not be re-executed. Instead, their outputs will be pulled from the cache\n",
    "  and inserted into your site.\n",
    "* Notebooks that **have any change to their code cells** will be re-executed, and the\n",
    "  cache will be updated with the new outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable cacheing of notebook outputs, use the following configuration:\n",

    "```yaml\n",
    "execute:\n",
    "  execute_notebooks: cache\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the cache will be placed in the parent of your build folder. Generally,\n",
    "this is in `_build/.jupyter_cache`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also specify a path to the location of a jupyter cache you'd like to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "execute:\n",
    "  cache: path/to/mycache\n",

    "## Execution FAQs\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does execution deal with relative paths in my code?\n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior of relative paths in your code is slightly different depending on\n",
    "whether you're executing with `auto` or with `cache`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **If executing with `auto`** notebooks will execute in the folder where they\n",
    "  exist and relative paths will work.\n",
    "* **If executing with `cache`** then the notebook will execute in a temporary\n",
    "  folder, and relative paths will not work. Support for relative paths is planned\n",
    "  for the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How can I include code that raises errors?\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, you may want to intentionally show code that doesn't work (e.g., to show\n",
    "the error message). To do this, add a `raises-exception` tag to your code cell. This\n",
    "can be done via a Jupyter interface, or via the `{code-cell}` directive like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "```{code-cell}\n",
    "---\n",
    "tags: [raises-exception]\n",
    "---\n",
    "print(thisvariabledoesntexist)\n",
