    "# Notebooks written entirely in markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to store Jupyter Notebooks in pure markdown. This allows you\n",
    "to define a notebook structure entirely using MyST Markdown. For more information\n",
    "about MyST Markdown, see {doc}`../content/myst`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks with markdown can be read in, executed, and cached by Jupyter Book (see {doc}`../content/execute`\n",
    "for information on how to cache pages). This allows you to store all of your\n",
    "notebook content in a text format that is much friendlier to version control,\n",
    "while still having all the functionality of a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "MyST notebooks use\n",
    "[jupytext to convert between ipynb and text files][jupytext].\n",
    "See its documentation for more information.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To see an example of a MyST notebook, you can look at\n",
    "[many of the pages of this documentation](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/tree/master/docs).\n",
    "For example, see {download}`../interactive/hiding.md` and {download}`../content/layout.md`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a MyST notebook with Jupytext\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to create a MyST notebook is to use [Jupytext][jupytext], a tool\n",
    "that allows for two-way conversion between `.ipynb` and a variety of text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can convert an `.ipynb` file to a MyST notebook with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupytext mynotebook.ipynb --to myst\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A resulting `mynotebook.md` file will be created. This can then be used as a page\n",
    "in your book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupytext can also **automatically synchronize an `.ipynb` file with your markdown**.\n",
    "To do so, use a Jupyter interface such as Jupyter Lab or the classic Notebook interface\n",
    "and follow the [Jupytext instructions for paired notebooks](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/paired-notebooks.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin} Markdown takes precedence\n",
    "If **both** an `.ipynb` and a `.md` file exist in your book's folders, then\n",
    "the `.md` file will take precedence!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convert a markdown file into Jupytext MyST markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Book has a small CLI to provide common functionality for manipulating and\n",
    "creating MyST markdown files that synchronize with Jupytext. To add Jupytext syntax\n",
    "to a markdown file (that will tell Jupytext it is a MyST markdown file), run the\n",
    "following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter-book myst init mymarkdownfile.md --kernel kernelname\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not specify `--kernel`, then the default kernel will be used *if there is\n",
    "only one available*. If there are multiple kernels available, you must specify one\n",
    "manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of MyST notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the structure that Jupytext creates, which you may also use\n",
    "to create a MyST notebook from scratch. First, let's take a look at a simple MyST notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "````md\n",
    "---\n",
    "jupytext:\n",
    "  formats: md:myst\n",
    "  text_representation:\n",
    "    extension: .md\n",
    "    format_name: myst\n",
    "    format_version: '0.8'\n",
    "    jupytext_version: 1.4.1+dev\n",
    "kernelspec:\n",
    "  display_name: Python 3\n",
    "  language: python\n",
    "  name: python3\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# My simple notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Some **intro markdown**!\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-cell} ipython3\n",
    ":tags: [mytag]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"A python cell\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## A section\n",
    "\n",
    "And some more markdown...\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main sections to notice:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Front-matter YAML\n",
    "\n",
    "MyST notebooks need special front-matter YAML to tell Jupytext that they\n",
    "can be converted to `.ipynb` files. The front-matter YAML block above:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "---\n",
    "jupytext:\n",
    "  formats: md:myst\n",
    "  text_representation:\n",
    "    extension: .md\n",
    "    format_name: myst\n",
    "    format_version: '0.8'\n",
    "    jupytext_version: 1.4.1+dev\n",
    "kernelspec:\n",
    "  display_name: Python 3\n",
    "  language: python\n",
    "  name: python3\n",
    "---\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Tells Jupytext that the file is in `myst` format, and that its code should\n",
    "be run with a Python3 kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "Remember that Jupyter always defines one, and only one, kernel per notebook.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Code blocks in MyST Notebooks are defined with the following MyST directive:\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "```{code-cell}\n",
    "your-code\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "You can optionally add extra metadata to the code cell, which will be converted\n",
    "into cell metadata in the `.ipynb` file. For example, you can add tags to your code\n",
    "cell like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "```{code-cell}\n",
    ":tags: tag1, tag2, tag3\n",
    "your-code\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also explicitly pass the kernel name after `{code-cell}` to make it clear which\n",
    "kernel you are running. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "```{code-cell} python3\n",
    "your-code\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "However, remember that there is only one kernel allowed per page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markdown content\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything in-between your code cells is parsed as markdown content using the\n",
    "[MyST Markdown parser](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/). See {doc}`../content/myst` for\n",
    "more information about MyST markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explicitly split up markdown content into two markdown cells, use the following\n",
    "pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "```md\n",
    "Content in one markdown cell\n",
    "\n",
    "+++\n",
    "\n",
    "Content in another markdown cell\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also attach metadata to the cell by adding a Python dictionary after the `+++`.\n",
    "For example, to add tags to the second cell above:\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "```md\n",
    "Content in one markdown cell\n",
    "\n",
    "+++ {\"tags\": [\"tag1,tag2,tag3\"]}\n",
    "\n",
    "Content in another markdown cell\n",
    "```\n",
